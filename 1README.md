 **Description** :pencil:

 This endeavor represents the realization of a shell, conceived as a significant milestone in the C code curriculum at ALX Africa Software Engineering. The Gates of Shell, undertaken during the initial trimester, serves as an educational initiative designed to deepen students' comprehension of advanced shell programming concepts. These encompass processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling.

 Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh).

This program was written entirely in C Language.
